A business owner I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company SO THAT I can organize and plan my business

GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I start the application
THEN I am presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role
WHEN I choose to view all departments
THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids
WHEN I choose to view all roles
THEN I am presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role
WHEN I choose to view all employees
THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to
WHEN I choose to add a department
THEN I am prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database
WHEN I choose to add a role
THEN I am prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database
WHEN I choose to add an employee
THEN I am prompted to enter the employee’s first name, last name, role, and manager, and that employee is added to the database
WHEN I choose to update an employee role
THEN I am prompted to select an employee to update and their new role and this information is updated in the database

## As the image illustrates, your schema should contain the following three tables:

* department
    * id: INT PRIMARY KEY
    * name: VARCHAR(30) to hold department name
* role
    * id: INT PRIMARY KEY
    * title: VARCHAR(30) to hold role title
    * salary: DECIMAL to hold role salary
    * department_id: INT to hold reference to department role belongs to
* employee
    * id: INT PRIMARY KEY
    * first_name: VARCHAR(30) to hold employee first name
    * last_name: VARCHAR(30) to hold employee last name
    * role_id: INT to hold reference to employee role
    * manager_id: INT to hold reference to another employee that is the manager of the current employee (null if the employee has no manager)

You might want to use a separate file that contains functions for performing specific SQL queries you'll need to use. A constructor function or class could be helpful for organizing these. You might also want to include a seeds.sql file to pre-populate your database, making the development of individual features much easier.

### Bonus

Try to add some additional functionality to your application, such as the ability to do the following:
Update employee managers.
View employees by manager.
View employees by department.
Delete departments, roles, and employees.
View the total utilized budget of a department—in other words, the combined salaries of all employees in that department.
